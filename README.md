# Drift

Drift is a cross-platform mobile UI framework in Go. It lets you write UI and
application logic in Go, then build native Android and iOS apps via the Drift
CLI, which generates platform scaffolding in a build cache and compiles your
app with CGO + Skia.

## Why Drift?

- **Single codebase** - Write your app once in Go, deploy to Android and iOS
- **Go-native** - Use Go's tooling, testing, and ecosystem you already know
- **Skia rendering** - Hardware-accelerated graphics via the same engine Chrome and Flutter use
- **No bridge overhead** - Direct native compilation, no JavaScript or VM layer
- **iOS builds on Linux** - Build iOS apps without a Mac using [xtool](docs/xtool-setup.md)

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.24
- Android builds: Android SDK + NDK, Java 17+, and `ANDROID_HOME` + `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` env vars
- iOS builds: macOS with Xcode installed
- Skia: prebuilt binaries, or see [skia.md](docs/skia.md) for building from source

## Quick Start

1. Install drift 

```bash
go install github.com/go-drift/drift/cmd/drift@latest
```

Make sure `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` or `GOBIN` is on your `PATH` so the `drift` command is available.

2. Create a new project:

**Option A: Using drift init (recommended)**

```bash
drift init hello-drift
cd hello-drift
```

**Option B: Manual setup**

```bash
mkdir hello-drift && cd hello-drift
go mod init example.com/hello-drift
go get github.com/go-drift/drift@latest
```

Then create `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/go-drift/drift/pkg/core"
    "github.com/go-drift/drift/pkg/drift"
    "github.com/go-drift/drift/pkg/widgets"
)

func main() {
    drift.NewApp(App()).Run()
}

func App() core.Widget {
    return widgets.Centered(
        widgets.Text{Content: "Hello, Drift!"},
    )
}
```

3. Run your app:

```bash
drift run android
# or
drift run ios --simulator "iPhone 17"
# or
drift run xtool
```

Skia binaries are downloaded automatically on first run. See [Skia Binaries](#skia-binaries) for manual download options or [docs/skia.md](docs/skia.md) for building from source.

4. (Optional) Add `drift.yaml` to customize app metadata:

```yaml
app:
  name: Hello Drift
  id: com.example.hellodrift
engine:
  version: latest
```

See the [usage guide](docs/usage-guide.md) for widget construction patterns, layout composition, state management, and theming.

## Skia Binaries

Drift requires prebuilt Skia libraries (`libdrift_skia.a`) which include both
Skia and the Drift bridge code. Download prebuilt artifacts from GitHub Releases
or build them locally (see [skia.md](docs/skia.md) for details).

```bash
drift fetch-skia              # fetch all platforms
drift fetch-skia --android    # android only
drift fetch-skia --ios        # ios only
drift fetch-skia --version v0.2.0  # specific version
```

Release artifacts are pinned to the Drift version and published under
`https://github.com/go-drift/drift/releases` with tags like `v<version>`.
For building Skia from source, see [skia.md](docs/skia.md).

## Build and Run Your App

From your app module root (where `go.mod` lives):

```bash
# Build
drift build android
drift build ios
drift build xtool

# Run on devices/simulators
drift run android
drift run ios --simulator "iPhone 17"
drift run xtool

# Clean build cache
drift clean
```

Notes:
- Android installs use `adb` and respect `ANDROID_SERIAL` if set.
- iOS builds require macOS and an Xcode project in the generated workspace.
- Xtool builds require xtool to be installed. See [xtool-setup.md](docs/xtool-setup.md).

## Repo Layout

- `cmd/drift`: Drift CLI commands
- `pkg/`: Drift runtime, widgets, and rendering
- `showcase/`: Demo application showcasing widgets
- `scripts/`: Skia build helpers
- `third_party/skia`: Skia source checkout
- `third_party/drift_skia`: Drift Skia bridge outputs

## Showcase App

The `showcase/` directory contains a full Drift demo. From the `showcase/`
directory, run:

```bash
drift run android
drift run ios
drift run xtool
```
