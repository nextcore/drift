/// DriftViewController.swift
/// View controller that manages the Drift rendering surface on iOS.
///
/// This controller is responsible for:
///   1. Hosting the DriftMetalView as its main view
///   2. Managing the CADisplayLink for vsync-synchronized rendering
///   3. Coordinating the render loop lifecycle with the view controller lifecycle
///
/// Rendering Pipeline:
///
///     Go engine calls scheduleFrame callback
///         │
///         ▼ scheduleFrame() unpauses display link
///     CADisplayLink (vsync signal)
///         │
///         ▼ drawFrame() selector
///     DriftViewController (this file)
///         │
///         ▼ renderFrame()
///     DriftMetalView
///         │
///         ▼ draw(to:)
///     DriftRenderer
///         │
///         ▼ DriftRenderFrame (FFI)
///     Go Engine
///
/// On-Demand Scheduling:
///   The CADisplayLink starts paused and is unpaused only when the Go engine
///   requests a frame via the schedule-frame callback. After rendering, if no
///   more frames are needed (e.g. animations have finished), the display link
///   is paused again. This avoids waking the CPU/GPU every vsync when the UI
///   is idle, matching the Android embedder's on-demand pattern.
///
/// Lifecycle:
///   - viewDidLoad: Creates the display link (paused) and registers callbacks
///   - viewWillAppear: Unpauses after reappearing (e.g. modal dismissal)
///   - viewDidDisappear: Invalidates the display link to save resources
