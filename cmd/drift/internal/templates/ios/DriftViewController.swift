/// DriftViewController.swift
/// View controller that manages the Drift rendering surface on iOS.
///
/// This controller is responsible for:
///   1. Hosting the DriftMetalView as its main view
///   2. Managing the CADisplayLink for vsync-synchronized rendering
///   3. Coordinating the render loop lifecycle with the view controller lifecycle
///
/// Rendering Pipeline:
///
///     CADisplayLink (vsync signal)
///         │
///         ▼ drawFrame() selector
///     DriftViewController (this file)
///         │
///         ▼ renderFrame()
///     DriftMetalView
///         │
///         ▼ draw(to:)

///         ▼ DriftRenderFrame (FFI)
///     Go Engine

/// Display Link:
///   CADisplayLink is a timer synchronized to the display's refresh rate
///   (typically 60Hz, or 120Hz on ProMotion devices). Using it ensures:
///     - Smooth animation without tearing
///     - Efficient battery usage (no spinning on the CPU)
///     - Automatic adaptation to display refresh rate
///
/// Lifecycle:
///   - viewDidLoad: Starts the display link when view is ready
///   - viewDidDisappear: Stops the display link to save resources
