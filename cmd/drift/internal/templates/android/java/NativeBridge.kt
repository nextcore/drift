/**
 * NativeBridge provides the Kotlin interface to the native Drift engine.
 *
 * This singleton object serves as the bridge between Kotlin code and the native
 * C/Go code that powers the Drift rendering engine. It handles:
 *   1. Loading the required native libraries (libdrift.so and libdrift_jni.so)
 *   2. Declaring external JNI functions that are implemented in C (drift_jni.c)
 *
 * Architecture:
 *
 *     Kotlin (this file)
 *           │
 *           ▼ JNI
 *     C bridge (drift_jni.c)
 *           │
 *           ▼ dlopen/dlsym
 *     Go engine (libdrift.so)
 *
 * Library Loading Order:
 *   The libraries MUST be loaded in this specific order because:
 *   1. libdrift.so is the Go shared library containing the engine
 *   2. libdrift_jni.so depends on libdrift.so (it calls its functions)
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - Call stepAndSnapshot() + renderFrameSync() from UnifiedFrameOrchestrator
 *   - Call pointerEvent() from your view's onTouchEvent() method
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 *   These functions are safe to call from any thread. The Go engine handles
 *   synchronization internally using mutexes.
